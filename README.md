# Accessibility Code Refactor

##Description

I performed this code refactor because online communication is very important and people that are disabled are entitled to use online communitcation. I built this project to make it more accessible to those with disabilities, as so many websites need to be up to date on accessibility standards. In this refactor I added accesibility attributes to all pictures. I learned that it was difficult to define accurate alternative atributes to help with visualization.
